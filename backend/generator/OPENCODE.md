### ⚖️ Project Standards

These rules are non-negotiable and apply to all agents working on this codebase.

- **Conventional Commits**: Never add AI attribution. Use `type(scope): description`.
- **Security-First**: All generated code must be audited via the Sovereign Compliance Agent.
- **No Build**: Never build after changes unless explicitly requested by the user.
- **SDD Workflow**: Use Engram persistence for architectural decisions and changes.
- **Strict TDD**: Follow the TDD cycle (Red -> Green -> Refactor) when implementing logic.
