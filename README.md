# 🛠️ Bob MCP Forge

> **Describe a tool in plain English. Get a secure, compliance-checked, production-ready MCP server in seconds.**

**IBM Dev Day: Bob Edition Hackathon — May 1-3, 2026**

---

## 🎯 The Problem

Two things are blocking enterprise AI adoption right now:

1. **MCP is the future, but it's developer-only.** Model Context Protocol is the hottest standard in agentic AI, but writing an MCP server requires deep technical knowledge. Non-engineers, PMs, and citizen developers are locked out.
2. **Enterprises don't trust AI-generated code.** GDPR, SOC2, HIPAA — every line of AI-generated code is a potential compliance landmine. Companies are afraid of data leaks, banned libraries, and insecure patterns.

## 💡 Our Solution

**Bob MCP Forge** is a web app that:
1. Takes a plain-English description of a tool ("search my emails", "check IBM Cloud costs", "look up patient records")
2. Uses IBM Bob to generate a complete, production-ready MCP server
3. Runs the generated code through our **Sovereign Compliance Agent** — an MCP-powered policy engine that audits for security and regulatory standards
4. Returns a clean compliance report → user fixes flagged issues → one-click deploy to IBM Cloud

**The combo wins:** the *generator* gives us the wow factor, the *compliance layer* gives us the enterprise trust IBM cares about.

## 🏆 Why This Wins the Hackathon

Mapped to the **4 judging criteria** (5 points each, 20 total):

| Criteria | How We Win |
|----------|------------|
| **Completeness & Feasibility** | Clean architecture, scoped MVP, deployable demo on IBM Cloud Code Engine. Every piece is realistic in 3 days. |
| **Creativity & Innovation** | Nobody has made MCP accessible to non-engineers. Combining generation + real-time compliance auditing is genuinely novel. |
| **Design & Usability** | Plain-English input → visual report → one-click deploy. A PM could use it. |
| **Effectiveness & Efficiency** | Solves two huge enterprise pains at once: AI accessibility + AI trust. Directly aligned with IBM's Trust + Security + Enterprise AI pitch. |

**Bonus IBM alignment:**
- Heavy use of **MCP** (matches Don Bourne's talk on MCP + IBM Bob + Liberty)
- **IBM Cloud** deployment target
- **Bob** is the core generator engine — we're showing what Bob can really do

### The Pipeline (User Journey)
1. **User input** → "I want a tool that searches my company's Slack messages"
2. **Generator** → Bob produces an MCP server: tool schema, handlers, auth, error handling
3. **Compliance scan** → Our MCP server checks the generated code against policy rules:
   - ✅ No hardcoded secrets
   - ✅ Approved libraries only
   - ⚠️ PII handling needs encryption (HIPAA flag)
   - ❌ Insecure direct API call (fix suggested)
4. **Report UI** → User sees pass/fail per rule, with auto-fix suggestions
5. **Deploy** → One click → containerized → live on IBM Cloud Code Engine

## 👥 Team & Roles

| Member | Role | Primary Responsibility |
|--------|------|------------------------|
| **Anthony** | Architecture lead | System design, compliance engine logic, integration glue, demo script |
| **Alejandro** | MCP / Agentic lead | MCP server generator, agentic flows (has built MCP servers before!) |
| **Dilshad** | Backend / DevOps | Backend API, database, IBM Cloud deployment pipeline |
| **Tien** | Frontend | React UI for input, report view, deploy flow |
| **Sadia** | Design / Docs / Pitch | UI/UX wireframes, documentation, final presentation deck |

**Philosophy:** Everyone gets exposure to every phase so we can all put this on our resumes.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Frontend | React + Tailwind | Fast to ship, looks polished |
| Backend | Node.js + Express | MCP SDK is best-supported in TS/JS |
| MCP SDK | `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` | Official |
| AI | IBM Bob | The whole point of the hackathon |
| Compliance Engine | Custom MCP server | Our differentiator |
| Database | MongoDB Atlas (or local SQLite for MVP) | Simple, free tier |
| Deployment | IBM Cloud Code Engine | Container-based, free tier |
| Repo | GitHub Org | TBD — invite emails coming |

## 🎬 Demo Script (60-second pitch)

> **[0:00]** "Enterprises want to use AI, but they're stuck. MCP is the standard for agentic AI tools — but it's developer-only. And nobody trusts AI-generated code in regulated industries."
>
> **[0:15]** "Meet Bob MCP Forge. I'll type what I want." *(types: "Tool that looks up customer records by email")*
>
> **[0:25]** "Bob generates the MCP server." *(code appears)*
>
> **[0:35]** "Our compliance agent scans it against GDPR, SOC2, HIPAA." *(report shows 1 warning, auto-fix offered)*
>
> **[0:45]** "I click fix. I click deploy." *(spinner → URL)*
>
> **[0:55]** "Live on IBM Cloud. Production-ready. Compliant. Built by anyone."
